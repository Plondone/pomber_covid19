# PomberCovid19

This gem provides an adapter to allow individuals to recieve Covid19 Data from a given country provided by [this repo] (https://github.com/pomber/covid19).  It shoots GET request to the following URL: 

`https://pomber.github.io/covid19/timeseries.json`.  

The Gem then takes in a country/region that you are looking for and returns data in the following format:

```
[
    {
      "date": "2020-1-22",
      "confirmed": 2,
      "deaths": 0,
      "recovered": 0
    },
    {
      "date": "2020-1-23",
      "confirmed": 3,
      "deaths": 0,
      "recovered": 0
    }
]
```
Where each JSON hash represents the Covid19 data for a given day.

If the request to the Covid19 URL fails, an `HttpRequestError` is raised.  If the region is not found, a `RegionNotFoundError` is raised.

## Installation
